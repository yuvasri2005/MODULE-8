# 🎓 Hackerrank:Python Program to Find Students with the Second Lowest Grade

This program reads student names and their corresponding grades, identifies the **second lowest grade**, and prints the names of all students who have that grade in **alphabetical order**.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program to:
- Read a list of students and their grades.
- Identify the second lowest grade.
- Print the names of students who have that grade, sorted alphabetically.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Read** an integer `n` representing the number of students.
2. **Read** each student’s name and grade, and store them as a sublist inside a list.
3. **Extract** all the grades and sort them.
4. **Identify** the second lowest grade from the sorted grade list.
5. **Collect** names of all students whose grade matches the second lowest grade.
6. **Sort** the names alphabetically.
7. **Print** each name on a new line.

## 💻  Program
```
l1=[]
l2=[]
for _ in range(int(input())):
    name = input()
    score = float(input())
    l1.extend([name, score])
    l2.append(l1)
    l1=[]
l3=[]
l4=[]
for i in l2:
    l3.append(i[1])
l3.sort()
for i in l2:
    if i[1]==l3[1]:
        l4.append(i[0])
l4.sort()
for i in l4:
    print(i)
```
